## A2 - Recreating conda environments
For this assignment, I used the Anaconda Powershell Prompt.

1) **Acquire files**
I cloned the required files from [here](https://github.com/augustinh22/geo-software-dev/tree/main/A2).

2) **Recreating environment 1**
For this, I used the commandline.

The v1 dev loaded fine with no errors.
I did update conda before continuing.
I then activated the environment and listed its contents to ensure it had loaded correctly.

After doing this, I deactivated the environment.

3) **Recreating environment 2**
Again, I used the commandline to carry out the following:

The v2 dev loaded fine with no errors.
Again, I activated and listed the contents of the environment to ensure things had loaded correctly

All looked okay, so again I deactivated this environment.
